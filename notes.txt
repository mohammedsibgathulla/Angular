1. What Is Angular? 
- Angular is JavaScript Framework which allows you to create reactive SPAs.

2. Angular vs Angular 2 vs Angular 9
- See the image.

3. CLI Deep Dive & Troubleshooting
	If the CLI prompts you to answer some questions (some versions do that), you can simply hit ENTER for all questions. This will accept the default settings which are fine for this course.

	The CLI generates a different welcome screen than you're going to see in my video though. No worries, you'll still be able to follow along without issues! Just make sure to code along so that your code equals mine - Angular itself didn't change a bit :)

	-----

	If you want to dive deeper into the CLI and learn more about its usage, have a look at its official documentation: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki

	You encountered issues during the installation of the CLI or setup of a new Angular project?

	A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.

	Updating NodeJS:

	Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.

	Updating npm:

	Run [sudo] npm install -g npm  (sudo  is only required on Mac/ Linux)

	Updating the CLI

	[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli 

	npm cache verify 

	[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli 

	Here are some common issues & solutions:

	    Creation of a new project takes forever (longer than 3 minutes)
	    That happens on Windows from time to time => Try running the command line as administrator

	    You get an EADDR error (Address already in use)
	    You might already have another ng serve process running - make sure to quit that or use ng serve --port ANOTHERPORT  to serve your project on a new port

	    My changes are not reflected in the browser (App is not compiling)
	    Check if the window running ng serve  displays an error. If that's not the case, make sure you're using the latest CLI version and try restarting your CLI

4. Project Setup & First App
- npm install -g @angular/cli
- ng new my-app
- cd my-app
- ng serve	    

5. Editing The First App
- {{name}} for property binding.
- [(ngModel)] = "name" for two way data binding.
- See the project. 

6. Adding Bootstrap For Styling
- npm install --save bootstrap@4 
- Go to angular.json config file and add "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" for the styles array.
- See the project.

7. How An Angular App Gets Loaded And Started
- The code from main.ts file gets first executed.
- platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule).catch(err => console.error(err)); //This line will start our application by passing the AppModule as param.
-  bootstrap: [AppComponent] //this is the bootsrap array in app.module.ts which basically lists all the components which should be known to Angular at the point of time it analyzes our index.html file. 

8. Creating A New Component
- ng g c component-name(server)
- app.module.ts containts declartations, imports, providers and bootstrap array. Where the boostrap responsibilty is to tell angular which component should be aware of at the point of time the whole application starts. Which component should be basically recognized in the index.html file.
- Now we have created a new component that need to be registred hence we need to add it to the declarations array.
- See the project for details.

9. Working With Component Templates
- See the project.

10. Working With Component Styles
- You can add multiple style sheets to the styleUrls array in the component.
- You can write inline css using the styles: [] array.
- See the project. 

11. Fully Understanding The Component Selector
- We are using the selector as an element, we can use it an attribte and a class.
- Selecting by id won't work.  It is not supported by angular.
- We typically use the element style for components. 
- See the project.

12. What Is Data Binding?
- Data Binding is the communication between the typescript code and the html template.
- See the image.

13. String Interpolation
- What ever is inside the curly braces somehow has to written a string or a thing that can be converted to string exactly. It could be a method also.
- You can't use multiline expressions like if or for. You can use ternary expression.
- See the project.

14. Property Binding
- Lot of time you can use property binding or string interpolation.
- You can do property binding for all the html element properties.
- See the project.

16. Property Binding vs String Interpolation
- If you want to output something in your template use string interpolation.
- If you want to change some property be of a html element or a directive or component use property binding.
- You can also call a method in the property binding.

17. Event Binding
- See the project.

18. Bindable Properties & Events
- How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to console.log()  the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers.

Important: For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click)).

The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for YOUR_ELEMENT properties  or YOUR_ELEMENT events  should yield nice results.

19. Passing And Using Data With Event Binding
- See the project. 

20. Two-Way-Databinding
- See the project. 

21. Combining All Forms Of Databinding
- See the project.

22. Understanding Directives
- Directives are instructions in the DOM.
- Components are such kind of instructions in the DOM.
- Components are directives with a template.
- There are also directives without a template.
- See the image.

23. Using ngIf With Else to Output Data Conditionally	
- * in the begining in *ngIf indicates that it is a structural directive that changes the DOM.
- We can put the else condition by using the local reference in <ng-template> which is a directive shipping with angular which you can use to mark places in the DOM.
- See the project.

24. Styling Elements Dynamically With ngStyle
- These are the attribute directives. Unlike structural directives attribute directives don't add or remove elements. They only change the element they were placed on. 
- They look like just normal html attributes without a * basically like ngStyle.
- We use property binding on this directive ngStyle so we use [ngStyle]. The square brackets indicate that we want to bind to some property on this directive and this property name also happens to also be ngStyle. The important thing that we want to understand is property binding is not the same as the directive it is totally different. We are binding to the property of the directive. Hence we are using an attribute directive to configure it we are using property binding.
- With the help of ngStyle we can dynamically update the style of the elements.
- See the project. 

25. Applying CSS Classes Dynamically With ngClass
- ngClass allows us to dynamically add or remove CSS classes. 
- See the project. 

26. Outputting Lists With ngFor
- See the project. 

28. Assignment Solution
- See the project.
